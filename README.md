Nanovert is a company that connects "nano-influencers" with coffee shops, restaurants and bars. The influencers get a discount on their purchase in exchange for putting up an instagram story advertising the product. I developed the first website for nanovert when it was a small endeavour of 3 people. The website allowed users to sign up to our list of users. We then connected with businesses which were interested in using these nano-influencers for their advertising and marketing.
